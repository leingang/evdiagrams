Edwards-Venn Diagrams in TikZ

This was a TikZ exercise to recreate the [Edwards-Venn diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram#Edwards.E2.80.93Venn_diagrams) such as I found in
chapter 4 of *[Another Fine Math you Got me Into...](https://www.amazon.com/Another-Youve-Into-Dover-Recreational/dp/0486431819)*  by Ian Stewart.

I didn't get far.
